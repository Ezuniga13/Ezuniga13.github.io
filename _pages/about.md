I'm an aspiring data scientist who excels at data wrangling, machine learning, exploratory analysis, and data visualizations. I have an interest in data structures and a passion for deep learning. As a former public school teacher I realized the importance of statistics and actionable insights in the way of making adjustments to lessons plans.
