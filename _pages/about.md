  Esteban first used statistics and data professionally when he was an educator. The school where he worked collected data and was able to use it to expect how well a class would do based on individual test scores from historical data. The goal was to balance classes by grouping stronger students with weaker ones for a particular subject. Esteban extended this concept of using data to take actionable insights by taking weekly assessments for the purpose of locating students that did not perform as well as others. He then would add a learning style to the lesson plan and re-assess if the student's score improved. If it did he used it as an indicator that the student had a different learning style and made sure to include it in the upcoming lesson plans.
