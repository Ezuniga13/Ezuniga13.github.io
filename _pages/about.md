  <p>Esteban first used statistics and data professionally when he was an educator. The school where he worked collected data and was able to use it to expect how well a class would do based on individual test scores from historical data. The goal was to balance classes by grouping stronger students with weaker ones for a particular subject. Esteban extended this concept of using data to take actionable insights by taking weekly assessments for the purpose of locating students that did not perform as well as others. He then would add a learning style to the lesson plan and re-assess if the student's score improved. If it did he used it as an indicator that the student had a different learning style and made sure to include it in the upcoming lesson plans. Because he wanted to help people on an  individual basis by resolving their legal issues he decided to attend law school.</p>
  
  <p>While applying to law school he recognized how important statistics were for law school because they provided data to students to let then know what the chances were for admission. This in essence was a data driven decision for the school and students to get an idea if it would be worth applying or accepting a student. When reading case law Esteban used a strategy of quantifying how many cases prevailed for a particular topic, then compared the fact pattern from those to the fact pattern for the case at hand. Using this stategy he could make a probability if the case had a good chance of prevailing or a poor one. This would help his overall analysis and would be able to use this method to better advise clients. However, by this time he realized he enjoyed more technical analysis and wanted to learn tools like Python, machine-learning and databases to make an impact. Data Science would be the ultimate platform to use these tools.</p>
  
  <p>Esteban was accepted to Metis and graduated in the Summer 2020 cohort. He is passionate about deep learning, data cleaning, and python data structures.</p>
