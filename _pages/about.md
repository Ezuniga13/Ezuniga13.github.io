  <p> My name is Esteban and welcome to my blog! I am a Data Scientist and recently graduated from Metis, a data science bootcamp. My past titles were Teacher and Law Student but I've been using data throuhgout my career.</p>
  
  <p> The school where I worked collected data and used it to make predictions on how well a particular class would do on standardized testing. The goal was to balance classes by grouping students who had done well with those who did not. I was able to extend this concept by using data to take actionable insights by taking weekly assessments for the purpose of locating students who did not perform as well as others. I then would add a learning style to the lesson plan and re-assess if the student's score improved. If it did I would consider that an indicator that the student had a different learnings style and made sure to include it in the upcoming lessons plans. Because I wanted to help people on an individual basis by resolving their legal issues, I decided to attend law school.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  <p>While applying to law school he recognized how important statistics were for law school because they provided data to students to let then know what the chances were for admission. This in essence was a data driven decision for the school and students to get an idea if it would be worth applying or accepting a student. When reading case law Esteban used a strategy of quantifying how many cases prevailed for a particular topic, then compared the fact pattern from those to the fact pattern for the case at hand. Using this stategy he could make a probability if the case had a good chance of prevailing or a poor one. This would help his overall analysis and would be able to use this method to better advise clients. However, by this time he realized he enjoyed more technical analysis and wanted to learn tools like Python, machine-learning and databases to make an impact. Data Science would be the ultimate platform to use these tools.</p>
  
  <p>Esteban was accepted to Metis and graduated in the Summer 2020 cohort. He is passionate about deep learning, data cleaning, and python data structures.</p>
